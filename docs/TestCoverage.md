# Test Coverage
Code coverage is a metric that measures the extent to which your codebase is tested by the test suite. 
It helps to determine how much of the code is being executed during the test runs. 

I used nyc tool instruments by inserting additional code that tracks which lines of code are executed during the test execution.
The following is the test coverage report for the url.js file.

# nyc tool 
nyc is a popular command-line tool and Istanbul's command-line interface for JavaScript code coverage. It stands for "istanbul/nyc" (New York City).

# File Coverage
File	   |  Statements | 	Branches |	Functions   |   Lines
url.min.js |  84.84%	 |     80%	 |    82.35%	|    100%

# Detailed Coverage
